have fun!

## usage
* Select your character, the rest of characters become your enemies, defeat all of them (sounds anti-social, does it have to be this way?)
* Select a enemy and click `fight` to start the battle
* Your character's attack power increases as the game goes on (what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger)
* After a enemy's defeated, pick the next one (ehh... sounds like a bullying game...)
* Defeated characters will no longer be available (including your character)
* Restart if you fail (just a game)

## hints
The challenge comes from picking the right enemies, not choosing the strongest player.

yeah, i known it's lame

## TODO
add motions
